Coleridge data science challenge on Kaggle


## steps https://www.kaggle.com/c/coleridgeinitiative-show-us-the-data 

- [x] load (download) data and setup 
- [x] explore and analyse data
- [ ] pipeline setup - modular, multiple handlable, simple transformer's dpr based at start
- [ ] inference
- [ ] prepare submit and submit - log the score with approach notes

- [ ] second iter


## idealog
- [ ] training gpt (gpt neo) on cloud just to predict these keywords (generative approach)
- [ ] first find out section for dataset mention by reverse search and then do the topic modelling on each of such to identify main keywords that hints about mention of data, use this keyword based search to shortlist section dataset mention, and then run a bert - like that predict exact span
- [ ] if simple search doesn't work do dpr reverse search



## notes 
>A percentage of the public test set publications are drawn from the training set - not all datasets have been identified in train, so these unidentified datasets have been used as a portion of the public test labels. These should serve as guides for the difficult task of labeling the private test set.
